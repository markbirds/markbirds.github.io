          Helloooooo! I'm Owen, a <small><q>cute</q></small> software developer
          with a passion for building apps. I mostly work on backend and
          web-based applications, but I can also build mobile and desktop apps.
          Outside of software development, I'm interested in learning more about
          blockchain and cybersecurity. Right now, my goal is to start a
          business, preferably in food or something related to software
          development.
