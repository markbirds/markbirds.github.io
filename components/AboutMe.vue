          Helloooooo! I'm Owen, a cute software developer with a passion for
          building apps. I mostly work on backend and web-based applications,
          but I can also build mobile and desktop apps. Outside of software
          development, I'm interested in learning more about blockchain and
          cybersecurity. Right now, my goal is to start a business, preferably
          in food or something related to software development.
